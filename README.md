# Airtable timeline assignment

## High level objective:

Design and implement a component for visualizing items on a timeline.

## How to run

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to initialize and connect to a node server with your default browser

## README assignments

- **What you like about your implementation.**

It's a basic implementation of a timeline interface with responsive design, without the use of a UI lib.

- **What you would change if you were going to do it again.**

I would start by getting the specifics about the final product, such as what is the core of implementation, what tools would I use. Then I would implement the basic funcionalities, before styling them (I styled first here). Lastly, I would refactor all of it's content on smaller components.

- **How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.**

I had the [MaterialUI alternating timeline](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-timeline/) as an inspiration for the design.

- **How you would test this if you had more time.**

I would use a testing library such as Jest, and make sure it's test coverage is 100%, with critical tests targeting UI and data usage.
